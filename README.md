### 🏠 Self-Hosted Deployment

**1. Deploy Libra Platform Itself**

All Libra platform services are deployed on Cloudflare Workers:

```bash

# Deploy various services to Cloudflare Workers
# Refer to the following workflow files for complete deployment process:
# - .github/workflows/web.yml - Main application deployment
# - .github/workflows/cdn.yml - CDN service deployment
# - .github/workflows/deploy.yml - Deployment service deployment
# - .github/workflows/dispatcher.yml - Routing service deployment
# - .github/workflows/screenshot.yml - Screenshot service deployment
# - .github/workflows/docs.yml - Documentation site deployment
```

**2. Deploy User Projects as PaaS Platform**

Libra uses **Workers for Platforms** technology to provide project deployment capabilities for users, offering two deployment service architectures:

1. **Workers for Platforms Architecture**:
    - Each user project is deployed as an independent Worker
    - Intelligent routing through `dispatcher` service
    - Support for custom domain binding
    - Completely isolated runtime environment (process-level isolation through Workers for Platforms)

2. **Deployment Service Architecture Options**:

   **V2 Queue Architecture** (`apps/deploy`):
    - **Cloudflare Queues**: Asynchronous queue processing for deployment tasks
    - **Batch Processing**: Support for concurrency control and batch deployment
    - **Dead Letter Queue**: Retry mechanism for handling failed deployments
    - **Use Cases**: High concurrency, large-scale deployment needs

   **V1 Workflow Architecture** (`apps/deploy-workflow`, deprecated):
    - **Cloudflare Workflows**: Step-by-step deployment orchestration
    - **State Persistence**: Built-in state management and recovery mechanism
    - **Complex Processes**: Support for complex deployment dependencies and conditional logic
    - **Use Cases**: Complex deployment processes, scenarios requiring precise control

3. **General Deployment Process**:
    - Verify user permissions and project quotas
    - Create sandbox environment for secure building (supports E2B or Daytona)
    - Sync project files
    - Execute build commands (`bun install` & `bun build`)
    - Deploy to user's Worker instance using Wrangler API
    - Update routing configuration, clean up temporary environment

4. **Technical Features**:
    - **Sandbox Environment**: Secure isolated build environment (supports E2B or Daytona)
    - **Global Distribution**: Leverage Cloudflare edge computing network
    - **Flexible Architecture**: Choose appropriate deployment service based on needs

### 🛠️ Technical Issues

**Q: What technical background is required to use Libra?**

A: Depends on usage method:

- **Hosted platform users**: No technical background required, just need to use a browser
- **Local developers**: Need basic web development knowledge and Node.js experience
- **Self-hosted deployment**: Need server and DevOps practical experience

**Q: How is the quality of AI-generated code?**

A: We always pursue production-grade code quality:

- Complete TypeScript type safety guarantee
- Follow modern React development patterns and industry best practices
- Responsive design implementation based on Tailwind CSS
- Accessible components integrated with Radix UI
- Clear and maintainable code structure and comments

**Q: Can I customize AI behavior and prompts?**

A: Full customization is supported in the open source version:
