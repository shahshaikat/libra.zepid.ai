## Overview

`apps/auth-studio` is a convenient launcher in the Zepid project, used to quickly access the Drizzle Studio management interface of the authentication database. It is essentially a script shortcut, not a standalone application.

**Important Note**: This is not a complete application, but a quick entry to the database management tool provided by the `@libra/auth` package.
