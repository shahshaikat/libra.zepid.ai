### How do I start my project?

Starting a project with Libra is simple and flexible. Choose the method that best suits your preferences and resources:

#### Prompt-based Development
Libra's prompt-based system makes application creation intuitive. Simply describe what you want to build in the prompt box. The more specific your description, the better the results.

**Example Prompt:** "Create a modern landing page for a SaaS startup. The design should feature a deep purple gradient background with glowing futuristic effects."

Start with clear and detailed prompts, then refine or adjust your project as needed.

## Project Configuration and Management

### How do I enable a database to store data?

Database functionality is not currently supported. Please stay tuned for updates.

### How do I enable AI in my application?

If your application requires AI functionality (such as AI assistance, smart recommendations, etc.), built-in AI features will be automatically enabled. No additional setup or configuration is required.

### How do I change the domain name?

Click "Site" in the sidebar to access the domain settings page.

**For free users:** Custom domains cannot be set; only the default zapid.dev subdomain is available.

**For Pro or Max users:** After completing deployment, you can add custom domains in the domain settings.

### How do I remove the "Built with Libra" badge from deployed pages?

For free users, the "Built with Libra" badge cannot be removed. If you upgrade to a Pro or Max plan, the badge will be automatically removed.

## Troubleshooting

### How do I fix "blank preview page" issues?

If the preview page appears blank, try these steps:

1. **Refresh the page**: First try refreshing the browser page
2. **Restore previous version**: Restore to a previous version by clicking the "History" button in the top-left corner of the preview window. This allows you to roll back to the last working version
3. **Request AI fix**: If the page is still blank, type in chat: "I see a blank page, please check and fix."
4. **Fork project**: Create a copy of the project, then delete the problematic original project

### How do I fix errors in the browser console?

For some errors, you can use the autofix button for automatic repair.

If you encounter errors in the browser console, copy the error message and paste it into the chat. AI can automatically diagnose and fix the issue.

**Example:**
```
Please fix error: react-dom.production.min.js:121 ReferenceError: useState is not defined at Dashboard ((index):194:88)
```

AI will analyze the error and provide appropriate fixes.

### Does fixing errors consume AI credits?

No, fixing errors does not consume any AI credits. This feature allows you to focus on perfecting your project without worrying about AI credit usage or additional costs. Note: To prevent abuse, we have implemented some limitations on the error-fixing functionality.

## Code Export and Deployment

### Can I export my website's code files?

Yes, you can export your website's code files without deploying the project. To do this:

1. Navigate to the website project you want to download
2. Click the "Code" tab at the top of the preview panel
3. Click the "Download Files" button in the bottom-left corner to download the code files

**Note:** Exported files do not include data from databases or any AI functionality related to the project. What's exported are static code files that you can deploy in local environments or other platforms.
