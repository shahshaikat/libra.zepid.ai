# Version History

Keep track of all changes to your project and go back to any previous version

## What is Version History?

Think of version history like a photo album of your project. Every time you ask Zepid to make changes, it takes a "photo" (creates a version) of your project. You can look back at these "photos" anytime and even go back to how your project looked before.

## What Can You Do with Versions?

With version history, you can:

- **Go back**: Return your project to an earlier version
- **Make copies**: Create a copy of any version to try different ideas

*Version management interface - Interacting with versions of your project*

## Going Back to an Old Version

When you "restore" to an old version, here's what happens:

- Your project goes back to exactly how it was at that time
- All the newer versions after that point get deleted forever
- You can start making new changes from that old version

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Once you go back, you can't undo it! All the versions that came after will be permanently deleted.

## Trying Different Ideas Safely

Want to keep your current version AND try something from an old version? Here's how:

1. Find the old version you like
2. Click "Duplicate" to make a copy as a new project
3. Now you have both - work on whichever you want!

## Tips for Success

### 1. Make Small Changes

Ask for one thing at a time instead of many changes at once. This way, each version is easy to understand.

### 2. Double Check Before Going Back

Make sure you select the right version before clicking "Restore" - remember, you can't undo this!

### 3. When in Doubt, Make a Copy

If you're not sure, make a copy instead of going back. This way you keep everything safe!
